### About myself
#### Hi there, I am Minh-Hien. ðŸ‘‹ <a name="en"></a>
#### A Junior Data Scientist based in Gent, Belgium.

I have a background in information technology, information systems development (got bachelor and master diplomes) and education. Being working at a multidisciplinary university in Vietnam, I started my job as a ICT assistant, web developer at Academic Affairs Dept, then a technical assistant of the university scientific journal (@Scientific Support Unit), and a post-graduated program adminstrator (@Graduated School)... My experieces are mainly about managing the data of undergraduate and graduate student records, developing the university management systems... I had chances to complete my dream of styding abroad by obtaining two scholarships for my master and Ph.D in the Netherlands and Belgium.
 
After finishing my Ph.D in 2020, I decided to start my journey on AI (Artifical Intelligence), began self-learning code (Python, R) and then I wanted to undertake a more in-depth and serious training. In May 2021, **Becode.org** offered me an opportunity to enter into the fascinating world of data sciences via their excellent full-time professional training. During the course, I practiced with several hand-ons projects in both #machine learning and #deep learning techniques. I've not only learnt from technical stuffs (e.g. committed errors of colleagues anf myself from personal and group projects), but also I practiced more on how to manage a successful project (MVP, Agile) and presented our product professionally to the clients. 

I am currently about to finish my intensive training. And I'm seriously looking for an internship to strengthen my professional skills before getting a full-time job in Data Sciences.
My favourite technologies to work with are: #python, #pandas, #matplotlib, #scikit-learn, #plotly, #tensorflow, #NLP.
Learning all about **Data Science, Machine learning**

You can ask me about **Data manipulation**, **Machine learning model creation**,**NLP**, **Model deployment**, **Web development**
